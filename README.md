# Elemental Damage Compat for Iron's Spells and Spellbooks

(This repository starts from version 1.1.1 of this mod)

This mod adds a new damage attribute for each element from ISS. It also adds crit chance to spells, and global crit chance as well. And it also prevents default attribute modifiers of weapon items from being overwritten when adding new attribute modifiers.
